Hello! 

I build my sauce code with Tokens IDE, which is a free text-based program for coding TI-BASIC applications, which is what the application will be built in. If you want to compile the app, or just edit it yourself, you can open the file in TokensIDE! Other IDEs may work, I have not tested any save for Tokens. 

The app is built with code compatible with TI-83/84+ calculators, including 83, 83+, 83+SE, 84+, 84+SE, 84+CSE. TI-82 compatibility may be possible, I do not own an 82 to test with. Voyager 200 compatibility is untested but I can assume existant. I'd like if someone could test this once I push some code. I don't guarantee TI-7x compatibility, nor can I guarantee TI N-Spires (including the CX) to work. 

I'll make an 8xp for each build, coupled with the txt file.

I need to do some ROM dumps on my calculator so that jusTIfied will test my apps, I can't use Wabbit since I don't own a compatible calculator to get a legal ROM.

About me:
My name is Devon, and I'm currently a freshman in high school. I'm making this program for current 8th graders/rising Freshmen, as not all the equations taught at my high school are easy to remember. I own a TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, that I've customized with a silver faceplate, Doors CSE 8, and installed a few games on. It was my first introduction to real programming, but it's the worst way to code ever. If you know the commands from the PRGM list, you just need to type them in, which can be faster than going back into the PRGM menu just to find the damn Lbl or Goto or Disp or whatever command.
